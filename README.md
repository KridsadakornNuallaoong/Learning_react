# Learning React with Vite

This project is a comprehensive guide to learning React using Vite as the build tool. It provides a structured approach to understanding React concepts, components, and best practices while leveraging Vite's fast development capabilities.

## Available Plugins

- **@vitejs/plugin-react** - Uses Babel (or oxc in rolldown-vite) for Fast Refresh
- **@vitejs/plugin-react-swc** - Uses SWC for Fast Refresh

## Features

- Fast development server with HMR
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- Minimal boilerplate to focus on learning

## Next Steps

- Explore React concepts and components
- Configure TypeScript for type safety (see [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts))
- Enable React Compiler for optimization (see [React Compiler docs](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation))
